# Guram Zhvania
_Lumbercamp Foreman_

## Appearance
Guram is a burly man in his early forties, with a grizzled appearance that reflects his hard-working nature. He has a thick beard, deep-set brown eyes, and a perpetual scowl etched into his weathered face. His clothes are practical and worn, bearing the marks of his trade.

## Background
Guram Zhvania is the no-nonsense foreman of the lumbercamp near Mtsika. Driven by a sharp focus on profitability, Guram ensures that the camp runs efficiently and that his men remain productive. His primary concerns are maintaining high output, preventing his lumberjacks from turning to poaching or embezzling, and securing his own financial future.
Guram is shrewd and vigilant, always on the lookout for any signs of dishonesty among his workers. He understands the temptations and challenges they face, but he has no tolerance for those who stray from their duties. His strict oversight has kept the camp relatively free of corruption, although it has also earned him a reputation for being harsh.
His ultimate goal is to amass enough wealth to leave Mtsika and buy a piece of property downriver before the usable lumber is stripped from the forest. Guram is well aware that the forestâ€™s resources are finite, and he is determined to secure his future before the opportunity vanishes. Despite his tough exterior, Guram is a pragmatic man, and his actions are driven by a desire to carve out a better life for himself once his work in the camp is done.
