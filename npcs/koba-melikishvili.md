# Koba Melikishvili
_Role: Pumpkin Farmer and Smuggler (Exiled)_

## Appearance
Koba is a middle-aged man with a rough and scarred appearance. His ears and nose bear the unmistakable marks of punishment, with slit scars marring his face. His dark, sunken eyes reflect a life of hardship and regret. Koba's unkempt hair and ragged clothing give him a disheveled look, adding to his outcast image.

## Background
Koba Melikishviliâ€™s past is steeped in crime and controversy. Once involved in a life of illicit activities, his downfall came when he was accused of selling his spouse as a slave to the Orxis. In reality, Koba was securing a contract with an Orxis band via a bit of wife-swapping, but this detail was lost on the local magistrates. The severe punishment left him with slit ears and nose, marking him forever as a criminal.

Forced to live alone across the river from Mtsika, Koba ekes out a meager existence as a pumpkin farmer. His isolation is both a curse and a survival tactic, keeping him away from the harsh judgment and mistrust of the villagers. Despite his tarnished reputation, Koba is a resourceful man, using his skills to cultivate the land and survive in solitude.

Koba's humble pumpkin farming is a front for his true position as a smuggler. Controlling the far side of the river crossing grants him limited but notable prestige, allowing him to discreetly move forbidden goods downstream and up the mountains. He ingeniously hides these contraband items in hollow pumpkins, using his knowledge of the land and his strategic position to avoid detection.

This dual life gives Koba a degree of influence and leverage over those who need to traverse the river or acquire illicit goods. Villagers and travelers must deal with Koba to cross, often begrudgingly acknowledging his authority in this matter. His smuggling operations add a layer of complexity to his interactions, as he balances maintaining his facade as a farmer with the covert activities that sustain him.

Koba's presence is a constant reminder of his past, but also of the crucial role he plays in the daily life of the settlement. While his notorious reputation keeps most at arm's length, his ability to provide forbidden goods and control the river crossing gives him a shadowy respect among those who know his true nature.
