# Nika Darashvili
_Substitute Castellan of the Fort_

## Appearance
Nika is a young man in his late twenties, with a lean build and an earnest expression. He has short, dark hair and brown eyes that reveal his determination and the weight of his new responsibilities. His clean-shaven face and youthful features contrast sharply with the rugged appearance of the local militia.

## Background
Nika Darashvili was Taron Gavras’s second-in-command, a role he fulfilled with dedication and enthusiasm. However, with Taron's mysterious disappearance, Nika has been thrust into the position of Castellan. Despite his motivation and willingness to learn, Nika is painfully aware of his lack of experience and the immense challenges ahead. He is in over his head and feels the pressure of living up to the legacy of his predecessor.
Nika's leadership is being tested as he tries to manage the fort's militia, composed of lumberjacks, farmers, and hunters serving their annual corvée duties. These men and women, accustomed to their primary trades, respected Taron’s seasoned leadership but are skeptical of Nika’s abilities. He is trying to earn their trust while struggling to keep the fort's operations running smoothly. Nika’s youth and inexperience are both his greatest challenges and his potential strengths. He is determined to prove himself and protect Mtsika, but he knows he has a long way to go to fill Taron's formidable shoes.
