# Taron Gavras
_Castellan of the Fort_

## Appearance
Taron is a man in his mid-forties, with a rugged and imposing presence. He has a strong jawline, sharp hazel eyes, and short, graying hair. A deep scar runs across his left cheek, a reminder of his many years of service.

## Background
Taron Gavras was the Castellan of the fort perched above Mtsika, known for his unwavering dedication and competence. A month ago, he insisted on conducting a patrol by himself—a task he had undertaken numerous times before. However, this time, he never returned. The village and fort are still grappling with his unexplained disappearance. Taron was well-respected, particularly for his understanding and efficient management of the fort's militia. These recruits, drawn from the village, served annual periods of corvée service rather than being professional soldiers. Taron's ability to turn these villagers into a disciplined and effective defense force was a testament to his leadership and skill.
**DM Notes:** Taron is in the Blood Peaks, tracking and surveilling the Orxis horde. The horde is now blocking his return to the fort, and he is trying to slow and sabotage their advance, single handed.
